HTTP/HTTPS Server in C — Goal Roadmap

Phase 1 — Foundations (TCP + Basic HTTP) Goal 1 — Create a listening TCP
socket - Bind to 0.0.0.0:8080 - Accept one client - Print raw request
bytes

Goal 2 — Send a minimal HTTP response - Parse only enough to respond
with “Hello World” - Handle GET / HTTP/1.1

Goal 3 — Serve static files - Map / → ./public/index.html - Detect 404 -
Add Content-Type

Goal 4 — Proper HTTP request parser - Read until  - Parse headers -
Store into struct

Phase 2 — Concurrency (Multithreading) Goal 5 — Thread-per-connection -
pthread per client

Goal 6 — Thread Pool - Fixed workers - Job queue - Mutex + cond var

Goal 7 — Graceful shutdown - SIGINT handling - Drain queue

Phase 3 — Modern HTTP Features Goal 8 — POST support - Use
Content-Length - Return JSON

Goal 9 — Keep-Alive - Support Connection: keep-alive - Reuse sockets

Goal 10 — Router module - Simple route(“/path”, handler)

Phase 4 — HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Goal 11 — Add OpenSSL - SSL_CTX - Load
cert/key - SSL_read/SSL_write

Goal 12 — Dual HTTP + HTTPS - Ports 8080 + 8443

Goal 13 — TLS config - TLS 1.2+ - Cipher suites

Phase 5 — Performance Mode Goal 14 — Non-blocking sockets Goal 15 —
Epoll/Kqueue loop Goal 16 — sendfile() for static files

Phase 6 — Extras Goal 17 — Logging Goal 18 — Config file Goal 19 —
Caching layer Goal 20 — Dynamic content
